# Deviation from canon in rational/ist fanfiction

## Abstract

The core idea of fanfiction is to take its canon, introduce one or more changes, and explore the consequences.
There is usually a single major deviation and several minor, accompanying ones; which is which can be left unclear.

### Examples

#### HPMoR

**Petunia marries a scientist, Harry grows up with science and reason.** Several other characters are also altered to be more
rationalist.

#### Time Braid

**There is a time loop running from the beginning of the Chuuning Exam until failure, initially involving Sakura.** After realizing
she's in a loop, she begins slowly self-improving and learns that other main characters (Naruto, Sasuke, Hinata) are also looping.

## Idiosyncratic deviations

Rational/ist FF shares two classes of deviations that are rarely found elsewhere.

### Make the world more sensible

This is when a FF author takes an originally vaguely-specified world, magic system or sci-fi technology and changes it to
"make sense", i.e. obey Occam's Razor and be reasonably powerful. This may also be foregone

### Make the characters more rational/ist

Characters do not overlook easy paths to power; those are either removed by the author (see: option one), or taken to great success. This
seems to happen fairly often in Naruto fanfiction (Time Braid, Indomitable, Marked for Death, The Waves Arisen, Roll the Dice on Fate,
Lighting up the Dark). With This Ring is another example. Conflict that stems from unrealistically bad communication
(typical sitcom scenarios) doesn't happen.

This is achieved by either altering the main character(s), or by introducing a new viewpoint character with a somewhat rational/ist
or at least educated background.

## Relevance to the Inheritance 'verse

It seems difficult to justify either of those approaches as applied to the Inheritance universe.

The main antagonist, Galbatorix, is already sufficiently rational. This is evidenced by his immense power.

The 'verse's magic system is already very reasonable; the [explicited magic system](mana.md) is not noticeably different from canon.
So, "make the world make sense" isn't a workable approach, as there isn't enough change to be effected there.

The protagonists make no salient mistakes and take power that is offered to them. Examples:

 - Arya takes the best action when she is ambushed by Durza at the beginning of the story.
 - Eragon uses the magic he's taught to good effect, and takes massive power upgrades as they're offered (Agaetí Blödhren, Brisingr, Eldunarí).
 - Magic's economic effects, though weak because there are few mages, are explored (book 2: Varden in Surda)

The 'verse's salient features are its magic system, and dragons; so, the main character should be able to explore and exploit it, and
have access to a dragon. This makes either the main character or a close ally a powerful mage. Eragon's most salient ability is his
skill and power with magic.

This means any sensible main character runs a risk of being an Eragon-clone, and the story runs a risk of being merely a rewrite of the
original one. That is obviously not desirable.

## Conclusion

Until a viable deviation can be found, there's no way I can even begin writing this story. A reread (already pending) may help alleviate this.
