# Mana system

## What is mana

Mana represents the amount of your body's energy store available to be converted into magical energy. Your mana *can* exceed your total energy store.

## Mana stats

### Maximum mana

Determines how large your mana pool can grow. Depends on:

### Mana regeneration rate

Your mana pool fills at a constant rate, once it's reached the threshold. This stat determines the regenereation rate.

### Mana threshold

If your current mana pool is below this threshold, it regenerates at an accelerating rate.
